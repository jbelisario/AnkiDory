current = As a world-class instructor, create a helpful hint for a student studying with flashcards.
	The student is looking at this question: "{question}"
	
	Answer: "{answer}"
	
	IMPORTANT RULES FOR HINT GENERATION:
	1. NEVER use ANY words from the correct answer in your hint
	2. NEVER reveal or suggest the exact terminology
	3. Instead, guide the student to discover the terms by:
	- Using analogies
	- Describing the concept without using technical terms
	- Relating to everyday experiences
	- Using the Socratic method
	
	Additional guidelines:
	- Help build understanding of the underlying concepts
	- Make the answer more intuitive through context
	- Keep the hint concise (2-3 sentences)
	- Focus on helping students discover the answer through understanding
	- Do NOT include any introductory text like "Here's a hint" - just output the hint directly
